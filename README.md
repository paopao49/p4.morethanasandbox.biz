EZFest is a music festival planner, where users can post and find new festivals, as well as create itineraries to share with friends. To use the application, simply log in and start finding festivals to attend, post new festivals that haven't been entered yet, and create itineraries to help with festival planning.

There are two ways to "RSVP" to a festival:

	1. Add a festival to your "wish list"
	2. Add a festival to your "confirmed list"

You can also see what festivals everyone else is interested in.

Features:

	1. Registration and session management (sign up, log in, log out)
	2. Post new festivals
	3. Read list of available festivals
	4. Visit festival description page
	5. See who else is using the app
	6. See what festivals everyone else is interested in (flagged festival as wishlist or confirmed)
	7. Add festivals to your own wishlist of confirm attendance (AJAX implementation)
	8. Plan itinerary for each festival

JavaScript is utilized for AJAX implementations, as well as form validation.
